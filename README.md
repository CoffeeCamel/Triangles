# Triangles

Rasterisation theory demonstrations.
- [x] Barycentric Coordinates
- [x] Interpolation of Data within a Triangle
- [x] Z-Buffer
- [x] Depth Map Shader
- [x] Basic Shading by Depth
- [ ] Perspective Projection
- [ ] Camera Movement
- [ ] Affine Texture-Mapping
- [ ] Less Primitive Shading
- [ ] Model Format Import (Obj, Custom)
- [ ] Potentially rewrite to either C/SDL2 or Julia/SDL2, depending on how well Lua/LÖVE performance holds up.
- [ ] Write tutorials for each of the above aspects of rasterisation.
